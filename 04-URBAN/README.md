# Urban – MapBiomas Chile

This folder contains the workflows used for **urban area mapping and characterization** within MapBiomas Chile Collection 2.  
The scripts implement a step-by-step pipeline for generating urban masks, preparing training samples, collecting spectral information, performing preliminary classification, and applying multi-year temporal filters to produce stable urban maps.
